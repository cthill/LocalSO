# LocalSO
LocalSO is a cross platform Stick Online server emulator written in Python. It works with the Stick Online client version 0.0227 and implements all features supported by the original game server.

The purpose of this project is to preserve Stick Online for all of its past players and fans. The official server was shut down long ago, and there is no source code available.

There is a public LocalSO server running. More info available at [https://www.local-so.com/](https://www.local-so.com/).

## Quick Start
Requirements:
 * Python 2.7.4 or later (2.7.14 recommended).
 * [The latest LocalSO release.](https://github.com/cthill/LocalSO/releases)

On Windows, run `start_server.cmd` and complete the first time setup:

```
02-03-18 16:24:24 root         INFO     LocalSO v1.5
02-03-18 16:24:24 db           INFO     Connected to database data/stickonline.db
02-03-18 16:24:24 db           INFO     Performing first time setup.
02-03-18 16:24:24 db           INFO     Creating database tables...
02-03-18 16:24:24 db           INFO     Done.
You must register an admin account.
  username: cthill
  password: password
Created admin account cthill
```

On MacOS or Linux, run:
```
$ cd server
$ python src/main.py
```

## Connecting To The Server
Before connecting, obtain a copy of the Stick Online client version 0.0227. It is available at [www.stick-online.com](http://www.stick-online.com/boards/index.php?topic=2.0).

To connect with an unmodified client, you must add two entries to your hosts file. Use notepad or another text editor to add the following entries to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
```
127.0.0.1	stickonline.redirectme.net
127.0.0.1	www.stick-online.com
127.0.0.1	stick-online.com
```
Start the client and it should connect to the server.

Note: you will not be able to connect to the official www.stick-online.com website without undoing these changes.

## Features
Status of server features.

Feature | Status | Description
--- | --- | ---
Admin Features | ✔️ working | The server supports admin commands prefixed by: `!`. Type `!help` in game for a full list.

Login | ✔️ working | See above.
Saving | ✔️ working | The client will periodically send "save" messages which contain current player status (such as spawn point, HP, items, etc.) and are saved in the database.
Chat | ✔️ working | In game chat is supported. Unlike the original game, there is no distance limit on chat messages. Admins can make chat announcements by using the ALT key.
Mobs | ✔️ working | All 19 mobs are fully supported. Mob stats are defined in `data/mob.json` and spawn points in `data/mob_spawn.json`. All mob AI is handled server side.
